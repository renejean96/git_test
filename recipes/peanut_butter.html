    <p>One reason your cookies may be falling apart is that they are too dry. You may have added too much flour. </p>
    <p>They may also be crumbly if you use margarine instead of real butter. Also, cookies that are not done all the way or cooled properly will fall apart when you move them.</p>
    <h4>Ingredient</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup shortening</li>
      <li>½ cup crunchy peanut butter</li>
      <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Cream shortening, peanut butter, and both sugars in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in egg until incorporated. Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl; gradually stir into peanut butter mixture until combined. Cover and refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Roll chilled dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto baking sheets. Flatten dough balls with a fork dipped in flour to form a crosswise pattern.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
