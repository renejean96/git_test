    <p>This classic summer salad is made with cucumbers, onions, and a simple creamy dressing.</p>
    <p>The dressing can vary from recipe to recipe, but it's usually either a sour cream or yogurt base with some sort of acid (lemon juice or vinegar), a little sugar, and dill.</p>
    <h4>Ingredient</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large cucumbers, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 sweet onion, thinly sliced</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

      <li>Turn cucumber mixture into a colander set over a bowl or in a sink. Let drain, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid and salt has drained, 15 to 30 minutes. Transfer drained cucumber mixture to a large bowl.</li>
      <li>Whisk mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, dill, garlic powder, and pepper for dressing together in a bowl until smooth. Pour over cucumber mixture and stir until coated.</li>
